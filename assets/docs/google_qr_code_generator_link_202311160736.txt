Git branching
Issue the following command in your Acme repo. It adds a new remote repository named upstream that points to the Generic repo.

```git remote add upstream https://location/of/generic.git```

You can then merge any changes made to Generic into the current branch in Acme with the following command:

```git pull upstream```

If you just want it to download the changes without automatically merging, use git fetch instead of git pull.
